Nipoppy is a command line tool to manage a complete neuroimaging processing workflow.  Nipoppy will organize and convert raw data, process it with existing or custom pipelines, and extract derived data for further statistical modeling and analysis.

### Development status

Nipoppy is complete as a system and is actively maintained.  Not all commonly-used pipelines are available out of the box.

### Innovation

Nipoppy is the first end-to-end tool for neuroimaging analysis, integrating other ReproNim tools.  To achieve this, Nipoppy addressed gaps in the existing tools.  By having identified and create ad-hoc solutions to these gaps, Nipoppy has created a road map for further development of existing tools and standards.
