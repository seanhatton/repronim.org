**[Actions](/about/principles/#repronims-four-core-actions)**: Standards, Annotation and provenance.

**Standards**: [BIDS](/resources/tools/bids/index.html), [NIDM](/resources/tools/nidm/index.html).

**Tools**: [Neurobagel](https://neurobagel.org/), [PyNIDM](/resources/tools/pynidm/index.html), [ReproLake](/resources/tools/reprolake/).

## Challenge

While the ultimate goal of reproducible neuroimaging *within* an experiment set is to obtain and preserve *both* the data and the associated details (metadata) as an integrated data set,  the larger objective is to save and store these integrated data sets in a manner that facilitates fully FAIR data sharing *between **sites*** and **studies**.  If data are poorly annotated, if everyone uses their own naming scheme, if data are all stored in different formats and metadata are scattered across different storage devices or investigator’s private drives, it becomes very difficult to find and reuse data, whether that data is **private to the lab/project** or **publicly available**. How do the FAIR principles apply? **Findable** means that PIs and project managers, for example,  can find the data, that is, it is annotated and stored in a way that allows search across all metadata.  **Accessible** means that users can easily retrieve the relevant data once found.  **Interoperable** means that the semantics of the metadata are clear and machine-processable so that related items can easily be retrieved and interpreted. **Reusable** means that the data have enough metadata and provenance recorded that the data can be understood and reused.

## Exercise

Here we will learn how to set up a **local** FAIR metadata store, which is known as a **ReproPond** in the ReproSystem.  We will learn how to add subject-level (meta)data to the ReproPond produced by following the Implementing data management basics:  Creating a BIDS Data Dictionary tutorial and learn how to perform queries using a user-friendly user interface (**Neurobagel**). Because the data and metadata are standards compliant, using BIDS and NIDM respectively, all such ReproPonds can be cross-queried, allowing, for example, multiple sites within a project to share metadata across a set of federated local nodes. We will also show how data can be retrieved from the **ReproLake,** a semantically aligned store of publicly-available datasets from OpenNeuro and other projects developed and maintained by ReproNim. Researchers can then use the **Neurobagel Query** tool to search across both ReproPonds and the ReproLake, using criteria like age, diagnosis, and other annotated variables. The query tool allows researchers to download both **participant-level** and **dataset-level** results, facilitating the discovery and retrieval of relevant data for cross-study analysis.

## Before you start

* Raw data files need to be organized as per the **BIDS format** (see [Converting DICOM to BIDS](/resources/tutorials/dicom-to-bids/) tutorial)
* A **data dictionary** that can be used for both BIDS and NIDM compliant representations for ReproPonds and Lake is available (see [Implementing data management basics:  Creating a BIDS Data Dictionary and Adding Semantics for FAIR](/resources/tutorials/data-dictionary/)
  * The ReproPond is built from the **nidm.ttl** file containing semantically-enhanced subject-level data
* The **Neurobagel tools** need to be installed.  To run the Neurobagel Docker, the Docker service needs to be installed on the host machine (refer [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/)).  Also ensure that there is a docker group setup and the current user is a member of the docker and root groups (as per [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)):

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo usermod -aG root $USER
```

* Make sure you have a working knowledge of git and git installed ([see the Git tutorial](/resources/tutorials/git/#step-1-install-the-necessary-tools) for more information).

## Step by step guide

### Step 1: Set up your local ReproPond using Neurobagel

Here we are going to mount your NIDM file (nidm.ttl) containing the study data using Neurobagel to create a local ReproPond.

First we install the Neurobagel Docker.  Please refer to https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/getting_started/ for full details.

Start by cloning the Neurobagel recipes:

```
git clone https://github.com/neurobagel/recipes.git
```

Make copies of the template configuration files to edit for your deployment (do not edit the templates themselves).

```
cp template.env .env
cp local_nb_nodes.template.json local_nb_nodes.json
```

In the .env file replace the placeholder value for NB_API_QUERY_URL (near line 65) with the address of the machine you are going to deploy Neurobagel on.

```
NB_API_QUERY_URL=https://XX.XX.XX.XX
```

If you are deploying Neurobagel for the local computer use: NB_API_QUERY_URL=https://localhost:8080 where :8080 is the default port for the federation API. For non-local implementations enter the IP address. Note: specify the protcol (i.e. https://). Please refer to the [detailed documentation for a complete overview of configuration options](https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/getting_started/).

```
NB_API_QUERY_URL=https://localhost:8080
```

In the .env file edit the LOCAL_GRAPH_DATA section (near line 28) to list the folder location of the graph data. This is the location to place your nidm.ttl files.

```
LOCAL_GRAPH_DATA=/home/user/Desktop/project_data
```

In the local_nb_nodes.json file specify a name for the local node and address (:

```
[
  {
    "NodeName": "My Datapond",
    "ApiURL": "https://local_ip_address"
  }
]
```
e.g.
```
[
  {
    "NodeName": "ReproPond",
    "ApiURL": "https://XX.XX.XX.XX"
  }
]
```

In the terminal window still in the recipes directory launch the docker by entering:

```
docker compose --profile full_stack up -d
```

Running the docker services for the first time, there should be a network interface, volume and four container services running.

![A screenshot of docker running.](/images/pond-lake-1.png)

Check that your docker containers have launched correctly by running:

```
docker ps
```

There should be four docker services running.

![A screenshot of the output of docker ps.](/images/pond-lake-2.png)

To stop the service enter:

```
docker compose --profile full_stack down
```

For full details of profiles and environmental variables at https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/config/. For additional information for maintaining a node refer to https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/maintaining/.

### Step 2: Use Neurobagel for cross-study queries

In this example multiple local nodes (ReproPond) and public nodes (ReproLake) are shown.

In a web browser access your own query tool at http://localhost:3000

![The Neurobagel query GUI.](/images/pond-lake-3.png)

Select between your local, federated nodes and the ReproLake node.

![The Neurobagel GUI being used to select a data source.](/images/pond-lake-4.png)

Select other attributes for your query (e.g. age, diagnosis) and click on the Submit Query button.

Select the desired studies and click to Download Participant-Level Results and Dataset-Level Results.

### Step 3: Download new data

Create a working directory for your project and place the Participant-Level and Dataset-Level Results TSV files inside.

Open a terminal window in the working directory.

Copy and run the following command:

```
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/data neurobagel/dataget:latest /data/dataset-level-results.tsv /data/participant-level-results.tsv /data/output
```

The downloaded data will be saved in a directory called output in the current directory.
