**[Reproducible neuroimaging principles](/about/principles/#repronims-four-core-principles)**: 2c: Annotate data.

**[Actions](/about/principles/#repronims-four-core-actions)**: Standards, Annotation and provenance.

**Standards**: [BIDS](/resources/tools/bids/index.html).

**Tools**: [ReproSchema](/resources/tools/reproschema/index.html).

## Challenge

Managing multi-site behavioral research projects presents significant challenges that can compromise data quality and research outcomes:

* **Version Control Chaos**: When questionnaires change mid-study, tracking which version each participant completed becomes nearly impossible without proper systems.
* **Cross-Site Inconsistencies**: Different research sites may interpret or implement the same assessment differently, leading to incomparable data.
* **Data Harmonization Nightmares**: Combining data from multiple sources often requires months of manual cleanup and reconciliation.
* **Reproducibility Barriers**: Without proper documentation and standardization, recreating a study or validating findings becomes extremely difficult.

ReproSchema addresses these challenges by providing a standardized, version-controlled framework for organizing and annotating behavioral data. It integrates seamlessly with existing tools while ensuring data remains consistent, traceable, and ready for both immediate analysis and long-term reuse.

## Exercise

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use ReproSchema to:

* **Understand ReproSchema's Architecture**: Master the five core components and how they work together to standardize data collection.
* **Design a Custom Data Collection Framework**: Create schemas tailored to your specific research needs while maintaining compatibility with common standards.
* **Implement Version Control**: Track every change to your assessments, ensuring complete reproducibility of your data collection methods.
* **Deploy Your Protocol**: Set up a working data collection system that can be used across multiple sites and devices.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have created a functioning ReproSchema protocol, tested it locally, and understand how to deploy it for real-world data collection. You'll also gain practical strategies for managing complex multi-site studies and ensuring long-term data usability.

## Step by step guide

### Step 1: Understand ReproSchema's Architecture

ReproSchema uses a hierarchical structure to organize assessments, making complex protocols manageable and reusable:

![A diagram of a hypothetical assessment and how it would appear in ReproSchema.](/images/reproschema_1.png)

**The Five Core Components:**

1. **Foundational Schema** ([reproschema](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema))
   - Defines the structure: Protocol → Activity → Item
   - Each element links to metadata (version, timing, conditions)
   - Uses JSON-LD format for semantic clarity

2. **Assessment Library** ([reproschema-library](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library))
   - Pre-built standardized assessments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHODAS, etc.)
   - Version-controlled and validated
   - Ready to use without modification

3. **Python Toolkit** ([reproschema-py](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-py))
   - Create and validate schemas
   - Convert between formats (REDCap ↔ ReproSchema)
   - Command-line tools for automation

4. **User Interface** ([reproschema-ui](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui))
   - Web-based data collection platform
   - Supports multimedia, branching logic, and scoring
   - Works on desktop and mobile devices

5. **Protocol Template** ([reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter))
   - Quick-start template for new projects
   - Proper folder structure and examples
   - Built-in best practices

![A diagram of the connections between the parts of ReproSchema.](/images/reproschema_2.png)

### Step 2: Explore a Demo Protocol

Before creating your own protocol, explore what's possible:

1. **Visit the Demo**: [https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/demo-protocol/main/DemoProtocol/DemoProtocol_schema](https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/demo-protocol/main/DemoProtocol/DemoProtocol_schema)

2. **Try Different Features**:
   - Text and numeric inputs with validation
   - Multiple choice questions with branching logic
   - Likert scales and visual analog scales
   - Audio recording capabilities
   - File upload functionality
   - Computed scores and progress tracking

3. **Examine the Code**: Clone the demo to see how it's built:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReproNim/demo-protocol
   cd demo-protocol
   # Explore the structure
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Your Data Collection Framework

**Create a Requirements Document:**

Start with a spreadsheet outlining your assessments:

| Variable Name | Question Text | Type | Required | Validation | Branching Logic |
|--------------|---------------|------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| participant_id | Participant ID | text | Yes | Alphanumeric, 6 chars | None |
| age | What is your age? | number | Yes | 18-100 | None |
| has_condition | Do you have diabetes? | radio | Yes | None | None |
| medication | What medication? | text | No | None | Show if has_condition = Yes |

**Check Available Assessments:**

Before creating new items, browse the library:
```bash
# View available assessments
https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/tree/main/activities

# Common assessments include:
# - Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
# - Mental Health (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS)
# - Cognitive (Trail Making, Digit Span)
# - Physical Health (WHODAS, pain scales)
```

### Step 4: Create Your Project

**Option A: Use the Cookiecutter Template (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter

# Generate your project
cookiecutter https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter

# You'll be prompted for:
# protocol_name: my_study
# protocol_display_name: My Research Study
# protocol_description: A study examining...
```

This creates:
```
my_study/
├── my_study_schema        # Main protocol definition
├── activities/            # Your assessments
│   └── example/          
│       ├── example_schema
│       └── items/        # Individual questions
├── README.md
└── protocols
```

**Option B: Convert from REDCap**

If you have existing REDCap instruments:

```bash
# Install the converter
pip install reproschema

# Convert your data dictionary
reproschema redcap2reproschema \
    --csv-path my_redcap_dictionary.csv \
    --output-path my_study/ \
    --protocol-name "My Study"
```

### Step 5: Build Your Assessments

**Create a New Activity (Assessment):**

1. **Make the directory structure**:
   ```bash
   cd my_study
   mkdir -p activities/screening/items
   ```

2. **Create the activity schema** (`activities/screening/screening_schema`):
   ```json
   {
     "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/main/releases/1.0.0/reproschema",
     "@type": "reproschema:Activity",
     "@id": "screening_schema",
     "prefLabel": "Health Screening",
     "description": "Basic health screening questions",
     "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "ui": {
       "order": [
         "items/age",
         "items/has_diabetes",
         "items/medication"
       ],
       "shuffle": false,
       "addProperties": [
         {
           "variableName": "age",
           "isAbout": "items/age",
           "isVis": true,
           "requiredValue": true
         },
         {
           "variableName": "has_diabetes",
           "isAbout": "items/has_diabetes",
           "isVis": true,
           "requiredValue": true
         },
         {
           "variableName": "medication",
           "isAbout": "items/medication",
           "isVis": "has_diabetes === 1",
           "requiredValue": false
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create individual items** (`activities/screening/items/age`):
   ```json
   {
     "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/main/releases/1.0.0/reproschema",
     "@type": "reproschema:Field",
     "@id": "age",
     "prefLabel": "Age",
     "description": "Participant's age in years",
     "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "question": "What is your age?",
     "ui": {
       "inputType": "number"
     },
     "responseOptions": {
       "valueType": "xsd:integer",
       "minValue": 18,
       "maxValue": 100,
       "unitCode": "years"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Update your protocol** to include the new activity in `my_study_schema`.

### Step 6: Test Your Protocol Locally

1. **Clone and set up the UI**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui
   cd reproschema-ui
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure for your protocol**:
   Edit `src/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     githubSrc: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my_study/main/my_study_schema',
     banner: 'My Research Study',
     startButton: 'Begin Assessment',
     assetsPublicPath: '/my_study/',
     backendServer: 'null'
   };
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Navigate through all questions
   - Verify branching logic works
   - Check validation rules
   - Test on different devices

### Step 7: Validate Your Schemas

Use reproschema-py to ensure your schemas are valid:

```bash
# Install if not already done
pip install reproschema

# Validate your protocol
reproschema validate my_study_schema

# Validate individual activities
reproschema validate activities/screening/screening_schema

# Check for common issues:
# - Missing required fields
# - Invalid references
# - Syntax errors in JSON
```

### Step 8: Deploy Your Protocol

**For Testing (GitHub Pages):**

1. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial protocol"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my_study
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Access via ReproSchema UI:
   ```
   https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my_study/main/my_study_schema
   ```

**For Production (With Data Storage):**

Follow the backend deployment guide:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-backend
cd reproschema-backend
# Follow Docker deployment instructions
```

### Step 9: Implement Advanced Features

**Add Computed Scores:**
```json
{
  "compute": [
    {
      "variableName": "total_score",
      "jsExpression": "q1 + q2 + q3 + q4 + q5"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-language Support:**
```json
{
  "prefLabel": {
    "en": "What is your age?",
    "es": "¿Cuál es su edad?",
    "fr": "Quel est votre âge?"
  }
}
```

**Complex Branching:**
```json
{
  "isVis": "age >= 18 && (has_condition === 1 || screening_score > 10)"
}
```
